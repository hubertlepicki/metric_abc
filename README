Metric ABC
==========

This little tool calculates ABC metric for your Ruby code. Requires Ruby 1.9 but should work more or less with sources compatible with 1.9 and 1.8.

Installation
============

$ gem install metric_abc

Usage
=====

    $ metric_abc filename1 [filename2] ...

Understanding output
====================

Output from metric_abc is in form of:

    /path/to/file.rb#Module1#Module2#ClassName#method_name: SCORE

where SCORE is a number. The higher SCORE is, the more crazy code is. If a method scores above 20, it very likely needs some refactoring because it's complete shit.

TODO:
=====

- method is not always properly recognized, sometimes it's full of shit like #@const#1#5#@const etc. Need to look at AST to figure out what's wrong
